It premiered in Sweden on Sveriges Television in January 2009, and the first guests to appear on the show were former Prime Minister of Sweden Göran Persson and his wife Anitra Steen. On 8 May 2009, it was announced that Skavlan had been renewed for a second season. It was also announced that the show would no longer only be produced by SVT in Sweden; Skavlan would now be partly produced in Norway by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. The first twelve episodes of Skavlan's second season were produced by SVT in Sweden, and the remaining twelve by NRK in Norway.\n\nSkavlan speaks Norwegian and his dialog is therefore subtitled in Swedish in Sweden, even though the two languages are quite similar and mutually intelligible. If the persons being interviewed by Skavlan are Swedish, he often tells them to let him know if they do not understand what he is saying. Swedish novelist Jan Guillou has criticized SVT for subtitling the program, stating \"there is no need for that. If the host had been Danish, subtitling would have been necessary, but with a Norwegian host it does not make any sense.\"","popularity":14.919,"poster_path":"/fkbNTpUwfbczVxeSlcSanEjAkrv.jpg","first_air_date":"2009-01-16","vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":7},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/tHrOhgJZpEy9qzA2tWx2w5dUTm3.jpg","genre_ids":[35,18],"id":1940,"name":"Entourage","origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Entourage","overview":"Film star Vince Chase navigates the vapid terrain of Los Angeles with a close circle of friends and his trusty agent.","popularity":37.584,"poster_path":"/siVOE6ZYzFQfVY7j0hakoqzr8Yf.jpg","first_air_date":"2004-07-18","vote_average":7.332,"vote_count":352},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/3vr4dAoT6eluIY16mjROK20QrR4.jpg","genre_ids":[10767,35],"id":1489,"name":"Jimmy Kimmel Live!","origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Jimmy Kimmel Live!","overview":"Jimmy Kimmel Live! is an American late-night talk show, created and hosted by Jimmy Kimmel and broadcast on ABC.","popularity":29.567,"poster_path":"/iVb1KSVTld3UDauahs3cv1HJhmi.jpg","first_air_date":"2003-01-26","vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":92},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/rALzi6BHoWdXuHjbOhzGjIKfhV4.jpg","genre_ids":[35,10764,10767],"id":62974,"name":"8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown","origin_country":["GB"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown","overview":"Jimmy Carr, Sean Lock and Jon Richardson take on the famous words and numbers quiz.","popularity":12.39,"poster_path":"/l4LGTlpRbGqgZURwzGXCZLHRr1k.jpg","first_air_date":"2013-04-12","vote_average":7.424,"vote_count":46},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/dvEgcDus45sslWmCzxdSkSTD8U7.jpg","genre_ids":[35,10767],"id":64614,"name":"En mode Salvail","origin_country":["CA"],"original_language":"fr","original_name":"En mode Salvail","overview":"What to expect: interviews, musical performances, a fierce band, surprising stories and most of all, guests who are more than happy to play along and follow Éric Salvail on his beautifully crazy tangents!","popularity":29.859,"poster_path":"/60LW30jI1P86aNRYzn3fk6UumBN.jpg","first_air_date":"2013-10-28","vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":2},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/ayOqM9CJxqB3ChvR6pNSYqe02Sn.jpg","genre_ids":[35,18,10765],"id":60957,"name":"My Love From Another Star","origin_country":["KR"],"original_language":"ko","original_name":"별에서 온 그대","overview":"Do Min Joon is an otherworldly beauty, literally.
