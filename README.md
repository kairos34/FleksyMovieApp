# FleksyMovieApp :tv:

The aim of this app is to replicate the high level functionality of www.themoviedb.org and showcase an android app out of it.
It connects with [TMDB_API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to give you top rated movies and show similar movies with selected one.
FleksyMovieApp consists of 2 pieces of UI right now:
1. Home with Top Rated Movies
2. Similar Movies with selected one

*Note: FleksyMovieApp is an unofficial app built only for learning and sharing the latest concepts with #AndroidDevs*
